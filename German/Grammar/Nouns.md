The nouns of the German language have several properties, some unique. German nouns possess three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. German nouns are declined (change form) depending on their grammatical case (their function in a sentence) and whether they are singular or plural:

## Cases

German has four cases:
* Nominativ: For the subject
* Akkusativ: For the direct object
* Dativ: For the indirect object
* Genitiv: Possessive

Examples:
